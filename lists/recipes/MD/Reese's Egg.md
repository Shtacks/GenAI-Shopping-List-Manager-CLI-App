## Ingredients

### Dairy

- Butter, melted (4 tbsp) - *unsalted*

### Pantry

- Creamy peanut butter (1 cup)
- Powdered sugar (1 cup)
- Semi-sweet chocolate chips (2 cups)
- Vanilla extract (1 tsp)

## Instructions

1. In a mixing bowl, combine creamy peanut butter, powdered sugar, melted butter, vanilla extract, and salt. Mix well until a dough-like consistency is formed.
2. Take a small portion of the mixture and shape it into an egg-like form. Repeat to make 10 eggs. Place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
3. Place the peanut butter eggs in the freezer to chill for 15-20 minutes.
4. In a microwave-safe bowl, combine semi-sweet chocolate chips and vegetable oil. Microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring in between, until the chocolate is fully melted and smooth.
5. Using a fork or toothpick, dip each chilled peanut butter egg into the melted chocolate, ensuring it is completely coated. Place back on the parchment paper.
6. Chill the chocolate-covered eggs in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour until the chocolate sets.
7. Serve and enjoy your homemade Reese's Eggs!

## Notes

For a smoother chocolate coating, you can temper the chocolate instead of melting it in the microwave. Simply melt 1 1/2 cups of chocolate, then remove from heat and stir in the remaining 1/2 cup until smooth.
